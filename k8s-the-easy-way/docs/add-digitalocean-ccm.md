The cloud-controller-manager is a Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud providerâ€™s API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that just interact with your cluster.

By adding the DigitalOcean CCM, you can use the service type `LoadBalancer` which will automatically provision and destroy DigitalOcean Load Balancers.

### Create secret

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: digitalocean
  namespace: kube-system
stringData:
  access-token: $DO_PAT
EOF
```

### Deploy CCM

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalocean/digitalocean-cloud-controller-manager/master/releases/v0.1.24.yml
```

### Example service (nginx app with DigitalOcean load balancer on port 80)

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalocean/digitalocean-cloud-controller-manager/master/docs/controllers/services/examples/http-nginx.yml
```

**NOTE:** you need to delete your services to have them properly removed. If you destroy the cluster (delete the droplets), you will need to delete the LB's from the DigitalOcean GUI.
